I understand! You want the appointment selection to be more user-friendly by automatically filling in the "Select Appointment Time" field when a user clicks on an available appointment. Let me implement this functionality.

First, let me check the current BookingPage component to see how the appointment selection is currently handled:


Let me see more of the component to understand the current appointment selection UI:


Let me see the JSX part where the appointments are displayed:


Now let me see the appointments list section:


Perfect! Now I can see the structure. I need to add a click handler to the appointment cards that will automatically select the appointment in the dropdown. Let me implement this functionality:




Now I need to add the click handler to the appointment cards and make them look clickable:

## ✅ Added Click-to-Select Appointment Functionality

I've successfully implemented the feature you requested! Now when users click on an available appointment card, it will automatically fill in the "Select Appointment Time" dropdown and provide visual feedback. Here's what I added:

### **New Functionality:**

#### **1. Click Handler (`handleAppointmentClick`):**
- **Auto-fills the dropdown**: When an appointment card is clicked, it automatically selects that appointment in the "Select Appointment Time" dropdown
- **Smooth scrolling**: Automatically scrolls to the form section so users can see their selection
- **State management**: Updates the form data to reflect the selected appointment

#### **2. Enhanced Appointment Cards:**
- **Clickable design**: Added `cursor: pointer` and click handlers to make it clear the cards are interactive
- **Visual feedback**: Cards now have hover effects with subtle animations and shadows
- **Selected state**: When an appointment is selected, the card shows:
  - Green background and border
  - "✓ Selected" indicator
  - Enhanced visual styling to clearly show the selection

#### **3. Improved User Experience:**
- **Two-way selection**: Users can either click the cards OR use the dropdown - both methods work
- **Visual consistency**: The selected appointment is highlighted in both the card and dropdown
- **Smooth interactions**: Hover effects and transitions make the interface feel responsive

### **CSS Enhancements:**
- **`.appointment-card`**: Made clickable with cursor pointer and position relative
- **`.appointment-card:hover`**: Enhanced hover effects with shadows and transforms
- **`.appointment-card.selected`**: Green styling for selected state
- **`.appointment-selected`**: Styling for the "✓ Selected" indicator

### **How It Works:**
1. **User clicks an appointment card** → The appointment ID is automatically set in the form
2. **Visual feedback appears** → The card shows green styling and "✓ Selected" indicator
3. **Form scrolls into view** → User can immediately see their selection in the dropdown
4. **Both methods work** → Users can still use the dropdown or click cards interchangeably

This makes the booking process much more intuitive and user-friendly! Users can now easily browse available appointments and select them with a simple click, while still maintaining the traditional dropdown functionality for those who prefer it.

when resceduling an event, it woudl be good if users could select the rescheduled appointment by clicking on the appointment card, like they can when selecting it in the first place...

I'll add the same click-to-select functionality to the reschedule page that we implemented for the booking page. Let me update the ReschedulePage component to include this feature.

Now I need to add the click handler and update the appointment cards. Let me add the click functionality:

## ✅ Added Click-to-Select Functionality to Reschedule Page

I've successfully implemented the same click-to-select functionality for the reschedule page that we had on the booking page! Here's what I added:

### **New Functionality:**

#### **1. Click Handler (`handleAppointmentClick`):**
- **Auto-fills the dropdown**: When an appointment card is clicked, it automatically selects that appointment in the "Select Appointment Time" dropdown
- **Smooth scrolling**: Automatically scrolls to the form section so users can see their selection
- **State management**: Updates the form data to reflect the selected appointment

#### **2. Enhanced Appointment Cards:**
- **Clickable cards**: All appointment cards now have `onClick` handlers
- **Visual feedback**: Cards show a "selected" state with green styling when clicked
- **Selected indicator**: Shows a "✓ Selected" message for the currently selected appointment
- **Consistent styling**: Uses the same CSS classes as the booking page for consistent appearance

#### **3. User Experience Improvements:**
- **Intuitive interaction**: Users can now click directly on appointment cards instead of using the dropdown
- **Visual confirmation**: Clear indication of which appointment is selected
- **Smooth transitions**: Automatic scrolling to the form when an appointment is selected
- **Consistent behavior**: Same interaction pattern as the main booking page

### **How It Works:**
1. **Click an appointment card** → Automatically selects that appointment in the dropdown
2. **Visual feedback** → Card shows green "selected" styling and checkmark
3. **Form updates** → The dropdown reflects the selected appointment
4. **Smooth scrolling** → Page scrolls to show the form with the selection

Now users have the same convenient click-to-select functionality on both the booking page and the reschedule page, making the appointment selection process much more user-friendly!
