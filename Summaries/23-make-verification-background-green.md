the background square in the Verify Your Email Address dialog should be green, like the home page colour, not purple.

I need to check the current styling of the email verification dialog and update the background color to match the green theme used on the home page. Let me first look at the EmailVerification component and its CSS.


I can see that the background is currently using a purple gradient (`linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)`). I need to check what green color is used on the home page to match it. Let me look at the main CSS file or the home page styling.


Let me check the App.css or any other CSS files that might contain the home page styling:


Let me check the HomePage.css to see what green color is used:


Perfect! I can see that the home page uses a green color scheme. Looking at the hero section, I can see the main green color is `#1e403a` (a dark green). The gradient uses various shades of green. Let me update the EmailVerification.css to use a green background that matches the home page theme.

Perfect! I've updated the email verification dialog background to use a green gradient that matches the home page color scheme. The new gradient uses:

- `#1e403a` (dark green) - the main color used throughout the home page
- `#2d5a3d` (medium green) - a mid-tone green
- `#4a7c59` (lighter green) - a lighter green shade

This creates a beautiful green gradient that's consistent with the Queen Street Gardens theme used on the home page, replacing the previous purple gradient.

The change is now complete - the "Verify Your Email Address" dialog will now have a green background that matches the home page color scheme instead of the purple background it had before.
