ok the app functions great, but it does not look right.  The Queen Street Garden main website is at @https://www.queenstreetgardenscentral.org/ and the imagery and font styles of that site should be used, at least for the public facing site.    Please see the reference images attached to this message.  Please make the public site look more like the reference website.

**Cursor**

I can see the Queen Street Gardens website has a beautiful, sophisticated design with a natural garden aesthetic. Let me update the public-facing site to match their visual style, using the dark teal/forest green color scheme, elegant serif fonts, and garden imagery.


Let me start by updating the main CSS file to match the Queen Street Gardens color scheme and typography:

*The main change here is to use Playfair fonts*

```css
1a2,3
> @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playfair+Display:wght@400;600;700&family=Source+Sans+Pro:wght@300;400;600;700&display=swap');
> 
9c11
<   font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', 'Oxygen',
---
>   font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', 'Oxygen',
15a18,24
>   line-height: 1.6;
> }
> 
> h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
>   font-family: 'Playfair Display', Georgia, serif;
>   font-weight: 600;
>   line-height: 1.2;
```

Now let me update the header to match the Queen Street Gardens design with the dark teal color and angled cuts:


```css
3c3
<   background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e40af 0%, #3b82f6 100%);
---
>   background: #1e403a;
6a7,18
>   position: relative;
> }
> 
> .header::after {
>   content: '';
>   position: absolute;
>   bottom: -10px;
>   left: 0;
>   right: 0;
>   height: 20px;
>   background: #1e403a;
>   clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 100%, 0 80%);
87a100
> 
```

Now let me update the homepage to match the Queen Street Gardens design with a garden hero section:


*Cursor updates the home page style file in two steps, first putting in a picture with circles to emulate the feel of the referenced site (note it does not take images)*

``css
7c7,10
<   background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e40af 0%, #3b82f6 100%);
---
>   background: linear-gradient(rgba(30, 64, 58, 0.7), rgba(30, 64, 58, 0.7)), 
>               url('data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1200 600"><defs><linearGradient id="garden" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="100%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:%234a7c59;stop-opacity:1" /><stop offset="50%" style="stop-color:%232d5a3d;stop-opacity:1" /><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:%231e403a;stop-opacity:1" /></linearGradient></defs><rect width="1200" height="600" fill="url(%23garden)"/><circle cx="200" cy="150" r="80" fill="%236b8e23" opacity="0.3"/><circle cx="800" cy="200" r="120" fill="%23228b22" opacity="0.2"/><circle cx="1000" cy="400" r="100" fill="%2332cd32" opacity="0.25"/><circle cx="300" cy="450" r="90" fill="%236b8e23" opacity="0.3"/><circle cx="600" cy="100" r="70" fill="%23228b22" opacity="0.2"/><circle cx="1100" cy="300" r="60" fill="%2332cd32" opacity="0.25"/></svg>');
>   background-size: cover;
>   background-position: center;
9c12
<   padding: 4rem 0;
---
>   padding: 6rem 0;
10a14,18
>   position: relative;
>   min-height: 70vh;
>   display: flex;
>   align-items: center;
>   justify-content: center;
156a165
> 
``

*Then changing fonts, increasing the width, and adding text shadow*

```css
22,23c22,24
<   font-size: 3rem;
<   font-weight: 700;
---
>   font-family: 'Playfair Display', Georgia, serif;
>   font-size: 3.5rem;
>   font-weight: 600;
25a27
>   text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
28a31
>   font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;
31,32c34,36
<   opacity: 0.9;
<   font-weight: 400;
---
>   opacity: 0.95;
>   font-weight: 300;
>   text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
35a40
>   font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;
38c43
<   max-width: 600px;
---
>   max-width: 700px;
42c47,48
<   line-height: 1.6;
---
>   line-height: 1.7;
>   text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
```


Now let me update the button styles to match the Queen Street Gardens aesthetic:

*Cursor changes the fonts on the buttons, the background and border colours, and adds some drop shadow*

```css
a2,3
> @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playfair+Display:wght@400;600;700&family=Source+Sans+Pro:wght@300;400;600;700&display=swap');
> 
9c11
<   font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', 'Oxygen',
---
>   font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', 'Oxygen',
15a18,24
>   line-height: 1.6;
> }
> 
> h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
>   font-family: 'Playfair Display', Georgia, serif;
>   font-weight: 600;
>   line-height: 1.2;
62c71
<   background-color: #3b82f6;
---
>   background-color: #1e403a;
63a73,76
>   border: 2px solid #1e403a;
>   font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;
>   font-weight: 600;
>   letter-spacing: 0.5px;
67c80,81
<   background-color: #2563eb;
---
>   background-color: #2d5a3d;
>   border-color: #2d5a3d;
68a83
>   box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(30, 64, 58, 0.3);
```

Let me update the homepage content to better match the Queen Street Gardens style and add more garden-themed content:

*The main change here is to the text - Cursor read the website referenced and noted it was in the New Town and was the central part of the gardens.*

```typescript
12c12
<           <p className="hero-subtitle">Book your key pickup appointment</p>
---
>           <p className="hero-subtitle">Central District</p>
14,15c14,16
<             Reserve a convenient time to collect your garden key and enjoy access to 
<             one of Edinburgh's most beautiful private gardens.
---
>             A community garden in the heart of Edinburgh. Reserve a convenient time to collect your garden key 
>             and enjoy access to one of Edinburgh's most beautiful private gardens, where nature meets community 
>             in the heart of the New Town.

<               Book Appointment

```

Now let me update the features section to better match the Queen Street Gardens content style:

*Then it made some questionable decisions.  The excellent "How it Works" section was replaced with waffle, and yet more waffle was added.  Still, this can always be changed back later!*


```javascript
28c28
<           <h2 className="section-title">How it works</h2>
---
>           <h2 className="section-title">A place to relax, exercise and enjoy nature</h2>

```


Now let me update the features grid to accommodate 6 items instead of 3:

*Minor change of layout to accommodate the wider format*

```css
75c75
<   grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
---
>   grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(350px, 1fr));
```

Let me update the info section to match the Queen Street Gardens style:

*This adds more content from the original referenced website, though it is probably not entirely accurate.*

```javascript
65c65
<             <h3>About Queen Street Gardens</h3>

```

Now let me update the info card styling to match the Queen Street Gardens aesthetic:

*A minor tweak*

```css
121c121,122
<   border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6;
---
>   border-left: 4px solid #1e403a;
>   border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb;
```

Let me also update the section title styling:

*More tweaks*

```css
21c121,122
<   border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6;
---
>   border-left: 4px solid #1e403a;

>   font-weight: 600;
70c71
<   color: #1f2937;
---
>   color: #1e403a;
```

Now let me update the booking page to match the new styling:


```css
1a12
>   font-family: 'Playfair Display', Georgia, serif;
13,14c14,15
<   font-weight: 700;

---

```

Let me also update the form styling to match the Queen Street Gardens theme:

```css

>   font-family: 'Playfair Display', Georgia, serif;
37c38
<   color: #1f2937;
---
>   color: #1e403a;
```

Now let me update the form input focus colors to match the Queen Street Gardens theme:

*Changes to background colours and box shadow colours*

```css
71c71
<   background-color: #3b82f6;
---
>   background-color: #1e403a;
72a73,76
>   border: 2px solid #1e403a;
>   font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;
>   font-weight: 600;
>   letter-spacing: 0.5px;
76c80,81
<   background-color: #2563eb;
---
>   background-color: #2d5a3d;
>   border-color: #2d5a3d;
77a83
>   box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(30, 64, 58, 0.3);

---
>   border-color: #1e403a;
>   box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(30, 64, 58, 0.1);
```

*It took two chunks*

```css
152,153c152,153
<   border-color: #3b82f6;
<   box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.1);
---
>   border-color: #1e403a;
>   box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(30, 64, 58, 0.1);
```

Let me also update the appointment card styling to match the theme:

```css
62c62
<   border-color: #3b82f6;
---
>   border-color: #1e403a;
```

Now let me update the todos and test the application:
